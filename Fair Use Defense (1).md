##**Introduction**

###An Accidental Encounter with Fair Use

I scroll slowly through my phone's itunes library as my boyfriend Joe guides us down the highway in his grey Rav 4, the trees streaking fast past our windows. I roll my shoulders back, loosening the muscles which tightened during our earlier date at the Monroeville batting cages, and peer closer at my phone's screen. 

As DJ, I am charged with playing "good" music--which (according to my boyfriend and I's similar musical tastes) generally involves anything other than country music.  When Flume's song, "Never Be Like You" ends, I scroll faster, looking for the next suitable song. DJ skills on the line, my finger taps a song downloaded from youtube, the screen reading: Birdy--Skinny Love (Vanic remix). 

The song begins with a pulsing, bubbling intro, Birdy's ethereal voice entering just as the music pauses, waiting for her. I smile, thinking it's beautiful. To my surprise, Joe does not.

"What is this?" He says, nose wrinkling in distaste as his hands grip the wheel. "A bad Bon Iver Remix?" 

I gasp, faux offended, but sincerely confused. This definitely isn't a Bon Iver song. "Nope," I correct him. "Its by Birdy. But this is the Vanic remix."

"Is is called Skinny Love?" he counters. 

I grimace, double checking my phone screen. "Yeah." 

"Bon Iver." He nods. "You should check out his original version--its awesome."

_Original_. The word bounces around inside my head as I type "Bon Iver Skinny Love" into Google. I hadn't known that there was a version more original than Birdy's, but sure enough, when I hit "go," Bon Iver's version shows up on YouTube--with less views that Birdy's, but with an earlier publication date. 

Even after listening to the Vanic remix of "Skinny Love" for two years, I never knew that the song was originally Bon Iver's. As the ballad hums mournfully through the car speakers, I ask myself: does that mean that Vanic's remix violates copyright law? I am genuinely curious: Is this song Fair Use? 


##**The Evolution of "Skinny Love"**
###From Ballad to Dubstep

After some research later at home, I had more of the facts, and was able to map the evolution of the song through several artists over several years. 

Bon Iver's song ["Skinny Love"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssdgFoHLwnk) is a guitar-strumming ballad from 2009, written in the mindset of a desperate lover who wants to heal a toxic relationship. In 2011, "Skinny Love" was covered by [Birdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNzCDt2eidg), who mimics the original song's tone but replaces Bon Iver's thrumming guitar with the delicate notes of a piano, her own voice adding an ethereal, echoing element to the music that was previously absent. Birdy's cover was then remixed in 2014 by the musical artist [Vanic](https://soundcloud.com/djvanic/skinny-love-vanic), whose version of "Skinny Love" incorporates dubstepy dance vibes and bubbling, thumping beats, making the listener forget that the original song was ever a mournful ballad.

I find it necessary to defend my intelligence and mention that I didn't miss any obvious cues indicating that the song originally belonged to Bon Iver. His name was not next to the song's title in my phone, or in the dropdown info box on YouTube. In fact, both Vanic's  "Skinny Love" YouTube page and his SoundCloud page do not mention Bon Iver at all--although they do credit Birdy. Trying to trace the Vanic remix back to Bon Iver was in some ways like following a trail of bread crumbs, picking up the pieces backwards until I came to the source of the music, as such: Vanic Remix > Birdy Cover > Bon Iver Original. 

In some ways, it is almost as though the listener is expected to do their own digging, and to trace the information back for themselves. 

This historical research, along with my inspection of the websites associated with the song has led me to a conclusion regarding the fair use status of Vanic's version of "Skinny Love," which I will discuss in the next section. 


##**Argument**
###Fair Use Defense

I argue that Vanic's remix of "Skinny Love" _**is**_ fair use, most notably due to its nature as being free and sharable, and its subsequent lack of commercial purpose.

To begin with some more abstract details details of the song that I find notable, yet lacking a direct fulfillment of the four terms of fair use:

1. On each site, each artist cites a previous artist, ultimately crediting the original artist, Bon Iver.  

  * For example, Vanic's "Skinny Love" YouTube page contains this, citing Birdy as the original artist:
> Birdy - Skinny Love (Vanic Remix) 
> http://smarturl.it/skinnylove
https://www.facebook.com/BirdyMusic
https://www.twitter.com/OfficialBirdy
https://instagram.com/Birdyinstagram

  * And Birdy's "Skinny Love" YouTube info contains this, citing Bon Iver as the original artist:
>"Skinny Love" by Bon Iver performed by Birdy from her debut album

2. The remix seems to have been reviewed and legitimized by both YouTube and SoundCloud, as the following licenses appear on their sites:

  * YouTube:

| Category | Music |
| --- | --- |
| Licence |Standard YouTube Licence |

  * SoundCloud:

>Skinny Love (Vanic Remix) by VANIC Official is licensed under a  Creative Commons License.

Ultimately, the legality of the song speaks for itself through its fulfillment of the four terms of Fair Use seen [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). 

Perhaps the remix's most validating factor is the fact that it is on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/djvanic/skinny-love-vanic) as well as [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37DIzz5Q2bM) (and other sharing sites, I'm sure) free of charge. Therefore, as per the terms of fair use , we can conclude:

1.  The remix is not for commercial use or garnering profit because it is free to the public (term 1) 
2.  The nature of the remix is that it exists as a downloadable, sharable file that can be found on multiple internet sites free of charge (term 2)
3. The remix retains Bon Iver's original lyrics and title, and is traceable back to Bon Iver's original song through Birdy's cover (term 3)
4. The remix has little effect on the potential market for Bon Iver or Birdy's original songs due to the fact that both Bon Iver and Birdy's versions of "Skinny Love" are also available online for free (term 4)

As Vanic's "Skinny Love" Remix fulfills all four factors, we can conclude that it is indeed Fair Use. 

##**Final Musings**
###Can You Really Define It All?

When I began to write this, I was running into a bit of a psychological wall that claimed that because Vanic does not directly cite Bon Iver, that the song is not Fair Use. But after reading through the terms, and thinking through the process, I have concluded that it is. 

Regardless, it seems that there are many people out there who would claim that due to this perceived lack of citation, that the song is illegal. And as I wrote this, I began to think of the remix in a way that seemingly contests that argument. 

I like to think of these remixed songs as being similar to research papers. Both are final products that were inspired by others ideas, but which are simply unable to cite every fragment of the inspiring idea. 

Sure, you could cite a book as a source in your paper, but (according to copyright implications existing in music) shouldn't you cite all of that book's citations too? The paper, and the book aren't stand-alone things, uninspired by other ideas, created independently of other sources--but yet each  claims its own title, and ultimately, its own citation, neglecting to mention the bits of extraneous inspiration along the way that came from other places. 

And if I can cite a book without citing the sources in the back of it, and without citing the sources of those sources, and back and back and back, then why should Vanic have to cite "Skinny Love" to Bon Iver when he's already cited Birdy?

The answer? He doesn't. 

I think that Fair Use has begun to acknowledge this practicality, and that sites like Creative Commons are beginning to push the boundaries of copyright and sharable information, so that perhaps in the future, we may have more digital freedom to mimic, cover, and remix.
